# Follow instructions in the GitHub repository in order
# to download the 2.2T of datasets required for Alphafold.

# i.e.:
git clone https://github.com/deepmind/alphafold.git
scripts/download_all_data.sh <DOWNLOAD_DIR>

# This downloads and unzips the files.
# I ran this overnight and it was done by the morning.
# You will need to specify the data download directory 
# if using the AlphaFold model.
